# Financial Risk Simulation and Analysis in R

## Introduction
Welcome to the Financial Risk Simulation and Analysis repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the stock market by simulating and analyzing the stock prices of various companies, with a focus on Microsoft Corporation. Using R programming, this project conducts technical analysis, risk assessments, correlation analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and trading strategy evaluation.

## Data Acquisition
The project utilizes stock price data for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), Intel (INTC), and Walmart (WMT) from October 1, 2009, to September 30, 2021. Data acquisition codes are provided for extracting and organizing the necessary data.

## Analysis and Simulations

### 1. Deriving Mean of Log Stock Returns
Calculate and derive the mean of log stock returns for each company and provide comments on the results.

### 2. Deriving Standard Deviation of Log Stock Returns
Calculate and derive the standard deviation of log stock returns for each company.

### 3. Creating a Comparative Data Frame
Create a data frame containing the average log return and standard deviation for each company. Compare the stock performances of the companies and discuss which stock you would buy and why.

### 4. Risk Analysis with Chart Series and Bollinger Bands
Perform risk analysis using chart series, particularly focusing on the year 2020. Consider utilizing Bollinger bands to assess stock volatility.

### 5. Correlation Analysis and Risk Assessment
Analyze the correlation among the companies' stock prices and explain the risk associated with buying stocks from the same or different sectors.

### 6. Monte Carlo Simulation for Microsoft Corporation
Simulate Microsoft Corporation's stock prices for the next 4 years using Monte Carlo simulations (300 simulations). Based on the simulation results, decide whether to buy Microsoftâ€™s stock and provide reasoning.

### 7. Suggested Trading Strategy and Evaluation
Propose a trading strategy along with an intuitive motivation. Implement and evaluate the trading strategy using the Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the risk involved.
